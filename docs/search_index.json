Click the link to read more about the license, or read more below in the license section. This lab manual is part of a larger OER course package for teaching undergraduate statistics in Psychology. Team members include, Matthew Crump, Alla Chavarga, Anjali Krishnan, Jeffrey Suzuki, and Stephen Volz. As this OER comes together, we will be providing a course website, written in R Markdown, as well as slide decks for the lectures (these will be more fully available by the end of fall 2018). As a result, this textbook, the lab manual, the course website, and the slide decks will all be free, under a creative commons license. The source code for all material is contained in the GitHub repositories for each, and they are a written in R-markdown, so they are relatively easy to copy and edit. Have Fun! 0.1.1 Attributions and Versions First Draft (version 0.9 = August 15th, 2018) This was the version we used to adapt the lab manual. That project can be found here. It was authored by Matt Crump (R exercises), Anjali Krishnan (JAMOVI exercises), Stephen Volz (EXCEL exercises), and Alla Chavarga (SPSS exercises). Labs 6, 7, and 8 were adapted and expanded from Open Stats Labs. Thanks to Open Stats Labs (Dr. Kevin P. McIntyre) for their fantastic work. Version 1.0 = April, 2021 This version was our first edit of the lab manual for PSYC 292 at StFX (Winter 2021), and was completed by Erin Mazerolle and Sherry Neville-MacLean. The changes were mainly focused on the SPSS sections of Labs 1, 2, 3, 6, and 7, and in particular, the homework questions. We also added Lab 12. Version 2.0 = April, 2024 We updated the lab manual to include JAMOVI activities that will use in PSYC 292 at StFX. Section 0.6 of Lab 0 was adapted nearly verbatim, with some editorial changes, from Chapter 3, “Getting started with jamovi,” from Navarro, D.J., &amp; Foxcroft, D.R. (2019).

Thank you to Navarro &amp; Foxcroft (2019). In this section, I’ll discuss how to get started in jamovi. I’ll briefly talk about how to download and install jamovi, but most of the chapter will be focused on getting you started with finding your way around the jamovi GUI. Our goal in this chapter is not to learn any statistical concepts: we’re just trying to learn the basics of how jamovi works and get comfortable interacting with the system. To do this, we’ll spend a bit of time looking at datasets and variables. In doing so, you’ll get a bit of a feel for what it’s like to work in jamovi. However, before going into any of the specifics, it’s worth talking a little about why you might want to use jamovi at all. Given that you’re reading this, you’ve probably got your own reasons. However, if those reasons are because that’s what my stats class uses, it might worth explaining a little why your lecturer has chosen to use jamovi for the class. Of course, I don’t really know why other people choose jamovi, so I’m really talking about why I use it. It’s sort of obvious but worth saying anyway: doing your statistics on a computer is faster, easier and more powerful than doing statistics by hand. Computers excel at mindless repetitive tasks, and a lot of statistical calculations are both mindless and repetitive. For most people, the only reason to ever do statistical calculations with pencil and paper is for learning purposes. In my class, I do occasionally suggest doing some calculations that way, but the only real value to it is pedagogical. It does help you to get a “feel” for statistics to do some calculations yourself, so it’s worth doing it once. But only once! Doing statistics in a conventional spreadsheet (e.g., Microsoft Excel) is generally a bad idea in the long run. Although many people likely feel more familiar with them, spreadsheets are very limited in terms of what analyses they allow you do. If you get into the habit of trying to do your real life data analysis using spreadsheets, then you’ve dug yourself into a very deep hole. Avoiding proprietary software is a very good idea. There are a lot of commercial packages out there that you can buy, some of which I like and some of which I don’t. They’re usually very glossy in their appearance and generally very powerful (much more powerful than spreadsheets). However, they’re also very expensive. Usually, the company sells “student versions” (crippled versions of the real thing) very cheaply, and then they sell full-powered “educational versions” at a price that makes me wince. They will also sell commercial licenses with a staggeringly high price tag. The business model here is to suck you in during your student days and then leave you dependent on their tools when you go out into the real world. It’s hard to blame them for trying, but personally I’m not in favour of shelling out thousands of dollars if I can avoid it, and you can avoid it. If you make use of packages like jamovi that are open source and free, you never get trapped having to pay exorbitant licensing fees. Something that you might not appreciate now, but will love later on if you do anything involving data analysis, is the fact that jamovi is basically a sophisticated front end for the free R statistical programming language. When you download and install R you get all the basic “packages” and those are very powerful on their own. However, because R is so open and so widely used, it’s become something of a standard tool in statistics and so lots of people write their own packages that extend the system. And these are freely available too. One of the consequences of this, I’ve noticed, is that if you look at recent advanced data analysis textbooks then a lot of them use R. Those are the main reasons I use jamovi. It’s not without its flaws, though. It’s relatively new1[As of writing this in August 2018.] so there is not a huge set of textbooks and other resources to support it, and it has a few annoying quirks that we’re all pretty much stuck with, but on the whole I think the strengths outweigh the weakness; more so than any other option I’ve encountered so far. 0.3.1.1 Installing jamovi Okay, enough with the sales pitch. Let’s get started. Just as with any piece of software, jamovi needs to be installed on a computer, which is a magical box that does cool things and delivers free ponies. Or something along those lines; I may be confusing computers with the iPad marketing campaigns. Anyway, jamovi is freely distributed online and you can download it from the jamovi homepage, which is: jamovi Homepage As previously indicated, the content of this section comes from Learning statistics with jamovi: A tutorial for psychology students and other beginners, Version 0.70, according to its CC license. At the top of the page, under the heading “Download,” you’ll see separate links for Windows users, Mac users, and Linux users. If you follow the relevant link, you’ll see that the online instructions are pretty self-explanatory. As of this writing, the current solid version of jamovi is 2.3.28, but they usually issue updates every few months, so you’ll probably have a newer version.2[Athough jamovi is updated frequently, it doesn’t usually make much of a difference for the sort of work we’ll do in this book. In fact, during the writing of the book, I upgraded several times, and it didn’t make much difference at all to what is in this book.] 0.3.1.2 Starting jamovi up One way or another, regardless of what operating system you’re using, it’s time to open jamovi and get started. When first starting jamovi, you will be presented with a user interface which looks something like [the figure below]. As previously noted in this section, this figure is copied from Learning statistics with jamovi: A tutorial for psychology students and other beginners, Version 0.70, according to its CC license. Thank you to Navarro &amp; Foxcroft (2019). To the left is the spreadsheet view, and to the right is where the results of statistical tests appear. Down the middle is a bar separating these two regions, and this bar can be dragged to the left or the right to change the sizes of the two view. It is possible to simply begin typing values into the jamovi spreadsheet as you would in any other spreadsheet software. Alternatively, existing data sets in the CSV (.csv) file format can be opened in jamovi. Additionally, you can easily import SPSS, SAS, Stata and JASP files directly into jamovi. To open a file, select the File tab (three horizontal lines signify this tab) at the top left hand corner, select Open and then choose from the files listed on “Browse” depending on whether you want to open an example or a file stored on your computer. 0.3.2 Analyses Analyses can be selected from the analysis ribbon or menu along the top. Selecting an analysis will present an Options panel for that particular analysis, allowing you to assign different variables to different parts of the analysis and to select different options. At the same time, the results for the analysis will appear in the right Results panel and will update in real-time as you make changes to the options. When you have the analysis set up correctly, you can dismiss the analysis options by clicking the arrow to the top right of the optional panel. If you wish to return to these options, you can click on the results that were produced. In this way, you can return to any analysis that you (or say, a colleague) created earlier. If you decide you no longer need a particular analysis, you can remove it with the results context menu. Right-clicking on the analysis results will bring up a menu, and by selecting Analysis and then Remove, the analysis can be removed. But more on this later. First, let’s take a more detailed look at the spreadsheet view. 0.3.3 The Spreadsheet In jamovi, data is represented in a spreadsheet with each column representing a variable and each row representing a case or participant. 0.3.3.1 Variables The most commonly used variables in jamovi are Data Variables, these variables simply contain data either loaded from a data file, or typed in by the user. Data variables can be one of three measurement levels: As previously noted in this section, this figure is copied from Learning statistics with jamovi: A tutorial for psychology students and other beginners, Version 0.70, according to its CC license. Thank you to Navarro &amp; Foxcroft (2019). These levels are designated by the symbol in the header of the variable’s column. The ID variable type is unique to jamovi. It’s intended for variables that contain identifiers that you would almost never want to analyze, for example, a person’s name or a participant ID. Specifying an ID variable type can improve performance when interacting with very large data sets. Nominal variables are for categorical variables which are text labels, for example, a column called Gender with the values Male and Female would be nominal. So would a person’s name. Nominal variable values can also have a numeric value. These variables are used most often when importing data which codes values with numbers rather than text. For example, a column in a dataset may contain the values 1 for males and 2 for females. It is possible to add nice, human-readable labels to these values with the variable editor (more on this later). Ordinal variables are like Nominal variables, except the values have a specific order. An example is a Likert scale with 3 being strongly agree and -3 being strongly disagree. Continuous variables are variables which exist on a continuous scale. Examples might be height or weight. Continuous scales are also referred to as Interval or Ratio scale. In addition, you can also specify different data types: variables have a data type of either Text, Integer, or Decimal. When starting with a blank spreadsheet and typing values in, the variable type will change automatically depending on the data you enter. This is a good way to get a feel for which variable types go with which sorts of data. Similarly, when opening a data file, jamovi will try to guess the variable type from the data in each column. In both cases, this automatic approach may not be correct, and it may be necessary to manually specify the variable type with the variable editor. The variable editor can be opened by selecting Setup from the data tab or by double-clicking on the variable column header. The variable editor allows you to change the name of the variable and, for data variables, the variable type, the order of the levels, and the label displayed for each level. Changes can be applied by clicking the tick to the top right. The variable editor can be dismissed by clicking the Hide arrow. New variables can be inserted or appended to the data set using the Add button from the data ribbon. The Add button also allows the addition of computed variables. 0.3.3.2 Computed Variables Computed Variables are those which take their value by performing a computation on other variables. Computed Variables can be used for a range of purposes, including log transforms, z-scores, sum-scores, negative scoring, and means. One way computed variables can be added to the data set with the Add button available on the Data tab. This will produce a drop-down menu in which you select where you want the variable to be placed. If you select Insert under the heading “Computed Variable,” the new computed variable appears to the left of the currently highlighted variable. If you select Append, the variable goes to the far right of all variables currently included (think “Appendix”). Alternatively, under the Data menu tab, you could select Compute. This command will lead to the newly computed variable appearing to the right of your currently highlighted variable. After making your selection, a formula box where you can specify the formula will appear. The usual arithmetic operators are available. Some examples of formulas are: A + B LOG10(len) MEAN(A, B) (dose - VMEAN(dose)) / VSTDEV(dose) In order, these are the sum of A and B, a log (base 10) transform of len, the mean of A and B, and the z-score of the variable dose. The figure below shows the jamovi screen for the new variable computed as the z-score of dose (from the `Tooth Growth’ example data set). As previously noted in this section, this figure is copied from Learning statistics with jamovi: A tutorial for psychology students and other beginners, Version 0.70, according to its CC license. Thank you to Navarro &amp; Foxcroft (2019). V-functions. Several functions are already available in jamovi and available from the drop down box labelled fx. A number of functions appear in pairs, one prefixed with a V and the other not. V functions perform their calculation on a variable as a whole whereas non-V functions perform their calculation row by row. For example, MEAN(A, B) will produce the mean of A and B for each row whereas VMEAN(A) gives the mean of all the values in A. 0.3.3.2.1 Rationale for Recoding This section and its subsection was developed by Sherry Neville-MacLean. This content is added to what was presented by Navarro &amp; Foxcroft (2019) for the purposes of a lab lesson. As you may recall from classes about research methods, one problem researchers using surveys face is response bias on the part of their participants. There are different kinds of response bias. For our purposes, consider participants who tire of answering survey questions and decide to select all extreme responses. These data are not useful. As one way to catch extreme responses, the researcher can word some of survey questions in the opposite way. Imagine an example where the researcher is using a scale on which “extremely agree” indicates participants score high on the construct being measured (ex. gratitude). Consider this survey statement: “On most days, I feel I have things in my life for which I am grateful.” A response of “extremely agree” indicates gratitude. The researcher may reword some statements in the questionnaire so that “extremely agree” indicates the participants score low on the construct. After rewording, another statement on the gratitude questionnaire might read like this: “I wish I were as fortunate as other people in my life who often come by success and/or material things more easily than I do.” A response of “extremely agree” indicates lack of gratitude. To be able to look at individual survey respondents’ score across all questions, their overall score on the gratitude scale, the researcher often, first, must recode some “negatively” worded items’ scores. In the above example, the second answer would need to be recoded before being considered with the answer to the first item, the “positively” worded statement. 0.3.3.2.1.1 An Example of Recoding and Computing a New Variable The following demonstration of how to recode data and compute a new variable is done using the example of the Perceived Stress Scale. This measurement tool is from Cohen, S., &amp; Williamson, G. (1988). Psychological stress in a probability sample of the United States. In S. Spacapan &amp; S. Oskamp (Eds.), The social psychology of health: Claremont Symposium on Applied Social Psychology (pp. 31–67). Newbury Park, CA: Sage. This material is being used educational purposes. Please be sure to follow copyright laws if you plan to reuse this material. Let’s consider a scale that is often used as a measure of stress in psychological studies, the Perceived Stress Scale, by Cohen and Williamson (1988). We can walk through the process of recoding data and data computations with this example. Let’s begin by looking at the scale itself. Perceived Stress Scale Instructions: The questions in this scale ask you about your feelings and thoughts during the last month. In each case, you will be asked to indicate how often you felt or thought a certain way. Although some of the questions are similar, there are differences between them and you should treat each one as a separate question. The best approach is to answer each question fairly quickly. That is, don’t try to count up the number of times you felt a particular way, but rather indicate the alternative that seems like a reasonable estimate. For each question, chose from the following alternatives: 0 = never 1 = almost never 2 = sometimes 3 = fairly often 4 = very often Questions: In the last month, how often have you… been upset because of something that happened unexpectedly? felt that you were unable to control the important things in your life? felt nervous and “stressed”? felt confident about your ability to handle your personal problems? felt that things were going your way? found that you could not cope with all the things that you had to do? been able to control irritations in your life? felt that you were on top of things? been angered because of things that happened that were outside of your control? felt difficulties were piling up so high that you could not overcome them? Those questions that are negatively worded in terms of the construct will be reverse coded before moving forward to a calculation. Indicate the numbers of the items that appear to be worded in terms that scoring a 4 (very often) would represent showing stress (the construct). (Notice: This question is not asking you if the construct of stress is positive or negative. It is asking if answering the question with a 4 would indicate a high level of the construct.) Write your answers on a sheet or in a document. Indicate the numbers of the items that appear to be worded in terms that scoring a 4 (very often) would represent showing lack of stress (the construct). (Notice: This question is not asking you if the construct is positive or negative. It is asking if answering the question with a 4 would indicate lack of the construct.) Write your answers on the same sheet or in the same document. Check your answers: If you answered that scoring a 4 on questions 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, and 10 would indicate stress, you are correct. If you answered that scoring a 4 on questions 4, 5, 7, and 8 would indicate lack of stress, you are correct! Notice that the “Stress” scale in the PSYC 291 Survey data dictionary is adapted from the PSS. In the PSYC 291 Survey, respondents were asked about these items, but for the past week, not the past month. The levels of the response options were the same as the PSS. For some reason, however, the data in the data set range from 1 to 5. It seems reasonable that 1 represents “never” and 5 represents “very often,” and we will proceed using this idea of the scale anchors. Let’s work through the process of computing a new variable (a composite variable) using the Stress items for T1 in the PSYC 291 Survey data file. As you can see in the data dictionary, T1 is “during the first week of classes in September.” The first step to computing the new variable is recoding. We need to recode items 4, 5, 7, and 8 before we can compute a composite score for all Stress items. We will begin by recoding item 4, shown as T1_stress4 in the data file. While the column for that item is highlighted, select Data, and then, select Transform. A new column will appear to the right of the column for the T1_stress4 and the variable attributes panel will drop down. (As you can imagine, you could also use these commands: Data, Add, and under “Transformed Variable,” either Insert or Append.) You can fill in the information for what you want this variable to be called and record its notable attributes. For our purposes, let’s call it T1_stress4_Recoded. You can see that the source variable is correctly shown as T1_stress4. Now, it is time to add the transform rule that you want used. Click on the white box after “using transform” and select Create New Transform. When you do click that button, a new panel will appear. Let’s fill in the information to tell JAMOVI what we want done to the data. We will give the transformation a name (“Reverse_Coding”) and click the Show formula editor button which looks like fx. A new panel opens, and we will enter the formula to have the transformations calculated. Because 5 is the maximum score value and 1 is the minimum score value, we can write this equation to get the recoded values: Go ahead and check the math on each of those recoded values! To close the transformation panel, click on the downward facing arrow. To get out of the Transformed Variable panel, click on the upward facing arrow. You should see the recoded T1_stress4 value in the T1_stress4_Recoded column. Repeat the steps to recode T1_stress5, T1_stress7, and T1_stress8. For these cases, you will not need to select Create New Transform. Instead, you will select the transformation rule you already created, Reverse_Coding . Now, you can see all 4 recoded values. Notice the transformed variables are noted with red circles by their names at the top of the columns. Recall the scoring instructions say that after recoding the values for these scale items, we should sum the scores. Let’s do that now. Move to the column for T1_stress10, highlight that column, and select Data and select Compute. If the Computed Variable panel does not drop down for you, click on Setup while the column for the new variable is highlighted. Let’s fill in the variable attributes and enter the formula for JAMOVI to follow to compute the sum. Remember, we want to include the recoded values for items 4, 5, 7, and 8. We do not want to include the original values for those items. One way to calculate the sum is by using the SUM command in the formula editor and placing all variable names you want included in the sum in the brackets behind the word SUM with commas between the variable names. Alternatively, you could select each variable name and use plus signs between them. As you did with the Transformed Variable panel, you can close the Computed Variable panel by clicking the upward facing arrow. This may seem like a lot of work to do for a score on one variable; however, you can imagine these commands and having JAMOVI do this recoding and computation work is a mega timesaver when you are working with a large data set or recoding and/or computations of many variables. 0.3.3.2.2 Z-scores (as a Type of Computed Variable in JAMOVI) This section was developed by Sherry Neville-MacLean. This content is added to what was presented by Navarro &amp; Foxcroft (2019) for the purposes of a lab lesson. There will be times when you want to compute z-scores. (For example, you may want to look at a large data set and decide whether you have extreme outliers.) Getting z-scores in JAMOVI is very easy. Let’s look at the process to get the z-scores for those Stress Composite Score values. In JAMOVI, z-scores can be obtained by selecting Data and Compute after the variable column is highlighted. As before, you can click on Setup while the column for the new variable is highlighted to fill in the Computed Variable attributes. When entering those attributes, you should also enter the formula for the z-score. The Z is found in the formula editor’s drop-down menu, but it can also be typed in. The variable name is in that drop-down menu, too. Similarly, it can be type instead. Remember to click the upward facing arrow to close the Computed Variable panel. Standardized Stress Score in the image below depicts the z-scores for Stress Composite Score. Notice that computed variables have a black circle to the right of their name near the top of the column. 0.3.3.2.3 Copy and Paste jamovi produces nice American Psychological Association (APA) formatted tables and attractive plots. It is often useful to be able to copy and paste these, perhaps into a Word document, or into an email to a colleague. To copy results, right click on the object of interest, and from the menu, select exactly what you want to copy. The menu allows you to choose to copy only the image or the entire analysis. Selecting copy copies the content to the clipboard, and this content can be pasted into other programs in the usual way. You can practice this later on when we do some analyses. 0.3.3.2.4 Syntax Mode jamovi also provides an “R Syntax Mode”. In this mode, jamovi produces equivalent R code for each analysis. To change to syntax mode, select the Application menu to the top right of jamovi (a button with three vertical dots) and click the “Syntax mode” checkbox there. You can turn off syntax mode by clicking this a second time. In syntax mode, analyses continue to operate as before, but now they produce R syntax and ascii output like an R session. Like all results objects in jamovi, you can right click on these items (including the R syntax) and copy and paste them, for example into an R session. At present, the provided R syntax does not include the data import step and so this must be performed manually in R. There are many resources explaining how to import data into R and if you are interested we recommend you take a look at these; just search on the interweb. 0.3.4 Loading Data in jamovi There are several different types of files that are likely to be relevant to us when doing data analysis. There are two in particular that are especially important from the perspective of this book: jamovi files are those with an .omv file extension. This is the standard kind of file that jamovi uses to store data, variables, and analyses. Comma separated value (.csv) files are those with a .csv file extension. These are just regular old text files and they can be opened with many different software programs. It’s quite typical for people to store data in .csv files, precisely because they’re so simple. There are also several other kinds of data file that you might want to import into jamovi. For instance, you might want to open Microsoft Excel spreadsheets (.xls files), or data files that have been saved in the native file formats for other statistics software, such as SPSS or SAS. Whichever file formats you are using, it’s a good idea to create a folder or folders especially for your jamovi data sets and analyses and to make sure you keep these backed up regularly. 0.3.4.1 Importing Data from CSV Files One quite commonly used data format is the humble comma separated value file, also called a .csv file, and usually bearing the file extension .csv. [These] .csv files are just plain old-fashioned text files, and what they store is basically just a table of data. This is illustrated in [the figure below], which shows a file called that I’ve created. As you can see, each row represents the book sales data for one month. The first row doesn’t contain actual data though; it has the names of the variables. As previously noted in this section, this figure is copied from Learning statistics with jamovi: A tutorial for psychology students and other beginners, Version 0.70, according to its CC license. Thank you to Navarro &amp; Foxcroft (2019). It’s easy to open .csv files in jamovi. From the top left menu (the button with three parallel lines), choose Open and browse to where you have stored the csv file on your computer. If you’re on a Mac, it’ll look like the usual Finder window that you use to choose a file; on Windows, it looks like an Explorer window. An example of what it looks like on a Mac is shown in [the following figure]. I’m assuming that you’re familiar with your own computer, so you should have no problem finding the .csv file that you want to import! Find the one you want, and then click on the “Open” button.

Thank you to Navarro &amp; Foxcroft (2019). There are a few things that you can check to make sure that the data gets imported correctly: Heading. Does the first row of the file contain the names for each variable - a header row? The {booksales.csv} file has a header, so that’s a yes. Separator. What character is used to separate different entries? In most .csv files, this will be a comma (it is “comma separated” after all). Decimal. What character is used to specify the decimal point? In English-speaking countries, this is almost always a period (i.e., {.}). That’s not universally true though. Many European countries use a comma. Quote. What character is used to denote a block of text? That’s usually going to be a double quote mark ({“}). It is for the {booksales.csv} file. 0.3.5 Importing Unusual Data Files Throughout this book, I’ve assumed that your data are stored as a jamovi {.omv} file or as a “properly” formatted .csv file. However, in real life, that’s not a terribly plausible assumption to make so I’d better talk about some of the other possibilities that you might run into. 0.3.5.1 Loading Data from Text Files The first thing I should point out is that if your data are saved as a text file but aren’t quite in the proper .csv format, then there’s still a pretty good chance that jamovi will be able to open it. You just need to try it and see if it works. Sometimes, though, you will need to change some of the formatting. The ones that I’ve often found myself needing to change are: header. A lot of the time when you’re storing data as a .csv file, the first row actually contains the column names and not data. If that’s not true, then it’s a good idea to open up the .csv file in a spreadsheet programme such as Open Office and add the header row manually. sep. As the name “comma separated value” indicates, the values in a row of a .csv file are usually separated by commas. This isn’t universal, however. In Europe, the decimal point is typically written as {,} instead of {.}, and as a consequence, it would be somewhat awkward to use {,} as the separator. Therefore, it is not unusual to use {;} instead of {,} as the separator. At other times, I’ve seen a TAB character used. quote. It’s conventional in .csv files to include a quoting character for textual data. As you can see by looking at the {booksales.csv} file, this is usually a double quote character, {“}. But sometimes there is no quoting character at all, or you might see a single quote mark (’) used instead. skip. It’s actually very common to receive .csv files in which the first few rows have nothing to do with the actual data. Instead, they provide a human readable summary of where the data came from, or maybe they include some technical info that doesn’t relate to the data. missing values. Often, you’ll be given data with missing values. For one reason or another, some entries in the table are missing. The data file needs to include a “special” value to indicate that the entry is missing. By default, jamovi assumes that this value is {99}3[You can change the default value for missing values in jamovi from the top right menu (three vertical dots), but this only works at the time of importing data files into jamovi. The default missing value in the dataset should not be a valid number associated with any of the variables, e.g. you could use {-9999} as this is unlikely to be a valid value.], for both numeric and text data, so you should make sure that, where necessary, all missing values in the .csv file are replaced with {99} (or {-9999}; whichever you choose) before opening / importing the file into jamovi. Once you have opened / imported the file into jamovi, all the missing values are converted to blank cells in the jamovi spreadsheet view. 0.3.5.1.1 Loading Data from SPSS (and other statistics packages) The commands listed above are the main ones we’ll need for data files in this book. But, in real life, we have many more possibilities. For example, you might want to read data files from other statistics programs. Since SPSS is probably the most widely used statistics package in psychology, it’s worth mentioning that jamovi can also import SPSS data files (.sav file extension). Just follow the instructions above for how to open a .csv file, but this time navigate to the .sav file you want to import. For SPSS files, jamovi will regard all values as missing if they are regarded as “system missing” files in SPSS. The Default missing value does not seem to work as expected when importing SPSS files, so be aware of this - you might need another step: import the SPSS file into jamovi, and then export as a .csv file before re-opening in jamovi.4[I know this is a bot of a fudge, but it does work, and hopefully this will be fixed in a later version of jamovi.]. And that’s pretty much it, at least as far as SPSS goes. As far as other statistical software goes, jamovi can also directly open / import SAS and STATA files. 0.3.5.1.2 Loading Excel Files A different problem is posed by Excel files. Despite years of yelling at people for sending data to me encoded in a proprietary data format, I get sent a lot of Excel files. The way to handle Excel files is to open them up first in Excel or another spreadsheet programme that can handle Excel files, and then export the data as a .csv file before opening / importing the csv file into jamovi. 0.3.6 Changing Data from One Level to Another Sometimes you want to change the variable level. This can happen for all sorts of reasons. Sometimes when you import data from files, it can come to you in the wrong format. Numbers sometimes get imported as nominal, text values. Dates may get imported as text. Participant ID values can sometimes be read as continuous. Nominal values can sometimes be read as ordinal or even continuous. There’s a good chance that sometimes you’ll want to convert a variable from one measurement level into another one. Or, to use the correct term, you want to coerce the variable from one class into another. In Section 0.6.3, we saw how to specify different variable levels, and if you want to change a variable’s measurement level, then you can do this in the jamovi data view for that variable. Just click the check box for the measurement level you want - continuous, ordinal, or nominal. 0.3.7 Installing Add-on Modules into jamovi A really great feature of jamovi is the ability to install add-on modules from the jamovi library. These add-on modules have been developed by the jamovi community, i.e., jamovi users and developers who have created special software add-ons that do other, usually more advanced, analyses that go beyond the capabilities of the base jamovi program. To install add-on modules, just click on the large {“+”} in the top right of the jamovi window, select jamovi-library and then browse through the various add-on modules that are available. Choose the one(s) you want, and then install them, as in [the following figure]. It’s that easy. The newly installed modules can then be accessed from the Analyses button bar. Try it…useful add-on modules to install include scatr (added under Descriptives) and \\R\\ j.

Thank you to Navarro &amp; Foxcroft (2019). 0.3.8 Quitting jamovi There’s one last thing I should cover in this chapter: how to quit jamovi. It’s not hard, just close the program the same way you would any other program. However, what you might want to do before you quit is save your work! There are two parts to this: saving any changes to the data set, and saving the analyses that you ran. It is good practice to save any changes to the data set as a new data set. That way you can always go back to the original data. To save any changes in jamovi, select Export...Data from the main jamovi menu (button with three horizontal bars in the top left) and create a new file name for the changed data set. Alternatively, you can save both the changed data and any analyses you have undertaken by saving as a jamovi file. To do this, from the main jamovi menu select Save as and type in a file name for this jamovi file (.omv). Remember to save the file in a location where you can find it again later. I usually create a new folder for specific data sets and analyses. 0.3.9 Summary Every book that tries to teach a new statistical software program to novices has to cover roughly the same topics, and in roughly the same order. Ours is no exception, and so in the grand tradition of doing it just the same way everyone else did it, this chapter covered the following topics: In Section 0.6.1, we downloaded and installed jamovi, and started it up. In Section 0.6.2, we very briefly oriented to the part of jamovi where analyses are done and results appear, but then deferred this until later in the book. In Section 0.6.3, we spent more time looking at the spreadsheet part of jamovi, and considered different variable types, and how to compute new variables. In Section 0.6.4, we also saw how to load data files in jamovi. Then, in Section 0.6.5, we figured out how to open other data files, from different file types. In Section 0.6.6, we saw that sometimes we need to coerce data from one type to another. According to Section 0.6.7, installing add-on modules from the jamovi community really extends jamovi capabilities. Finally, in Section 0.6.8, we looked at good practice in terms of saving your data set and analyses when you have finished and are about to quit jamovi. We still haven’t arrived at anything that resembles data analysis. Maybe the next Chapter will get us a bit closer!

A. Fisher This lab is modified and extended from Open Stats Labs. Thanks to Open Stats Labs (Dr. Kevin P. McIntyre) for their fantastic work. 1.1 How to not think about bad memories by playing Tetris This lab activity uses the open data from Experiment 2 of James et al. (2015) to teach one-way ANOVA with planned comparisons. Results of the activity provided below should exactly reproduce the results described in the paper. 1.1.1 Study description Following traumatic experiences, some people have flashbacks, which are also called “intrusive memories” and are characterized by involuntary images of aspects of the traumatic event. Although people often try to simply forget traumatic memories, this approach is not very effective. Instead, previous research suggests that a better approach may be to try to change aspects of the memory after it is formed. For example, some research shows that traumatic memories can be altered and weakened to the point that they are no longer intrusive. Because intrusive memories of trauma are often visual in nature, James and colleagues (2015) sought to explore whether completing a visuospatial task (e.g., Tetris) after a memory was formed would interfere with the storage of that memory, and thereby reduce the frequency of subsequent intrusions. They hypothesized that only participants who complete a visuo-spatial task after reactivation of the traumatic memories would experience a reduction in intrusive memories. In comparison, simply completing a visuo-spatial task (without reactivation) or reactivation (without a visuo-spatial task), would not reduce the occurrence intrusive memories. In other words, if you play Tetris shortly after you were remembering bad memories, playing Tetris might weaken those memories, which could cause you experience those kinds of intrusive memories less often in the future. 1.1.2 Study Methods To test their hypothesis, the authors conducted an experiment (N = 72, n = 18 per condition). The procedure is summarized as follows: Trauma Film: All participants viewed a series of video clips of graphic violence (e.g., a person getting hit by a van while using his phone as he crosses the road) as a way to create memories that should become intrusive memories. Participants then went home and recorded the number of intrusive memories they experienced over the next 24 hours. Because this is before the experimental manipulations, all groups were predicted to have an equal occurrence of intrusive memories during the first 24-hours (called Day 0). Experimental Task: After this 24-hour period, the participants returned to the lab and completed the experimental task. The experimenters randomly assigned participants to ONE of the following conditions: No-task control: These participants completed a 10-minute music filler task. Reactivation + Tetris: These participants were shown a series of images from the trauma film to reactivate the traumatic memories (i.e., reactivation task). After a 10-minute music filler task, participants played the video game Tetris for 12 minutes. Tetris Only: These participants played Tetris for 12 minutes, but did not complete the reactivation task. Reactivation Only: These participants completed the reactivation task, but did not play Tetris. Intrusive Memories: All participants were asked to record the number of intrusive memories that they experienced over the next seven days (Days 1 to 7). After the seven days had passed, participants completed an Intrusion-Provocation Task, in which they were shown blurred images from the trauma film and asked to indicate whether the blurred image triggered an intrusive memory. 1.2 Important Stuff citation: James, E.

Thank you to Crump, Krishnan, Volz, &amp; Chavarga (2018). In this lab (and the next lab), we will use JAMOVI to: Perform a One-Factor Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) and graph the data Planned comparisons: Use programmed contrasts to locate differences Unplanned comparisons: Use a post-hoc test to locate differences 1.3.1 Checking Assumptions Recall that the ANOVA is a parametric test, and the ANOVA test assumes: The sampling distributions are normally distributed. Consider the central limit theorem. The data are measured using an interval or a ratio scale. Consider what you know about how the data were collected and/or look at the variable attributes in the JAMOVI data spreadsheet. The scores are independent. Consider the experimental design and/or look at the JAMOVI data spreadsheet to verify whether or not different participants or subjects contribute to the means. The variances in the populations are roughly equal. Consider the result of Levene’s test. 1.3.2 Performing a One-Factor Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) &amp; Graphing the data First, let’s open the relevant data file in JAMOVI. You can find the file on Moodle. Your data should look like this: In this experiment, there was one important independent variable, called Condition, and it has four levels. In the variable attribute’s information, we see the levels are 1, 2, 3, and 4. These will correspond to the four levels in shown below (and these labels are shown in the data spreadsheet): No-Task Control Reactivation + Tetris Tetris Only Reactivation Only The dependent variable is recorded in the column Days_One_to_Seven_Number_of_Intrusions. This represents the mean number of intrusions for that week. We are testing the hypothesis that the number of intrusive memories will be different among the groups (1-4). For now, we will not specify which group we think is going to have the highest or lowest number of memories, but rather we will test if there is a difference SOMEWHERE between these 4 groups. Let’s begin. Go to Analyses, then ANOVA, then select One-Way ANOVA… Look at the the One-Way ANOVA commands panel on the left. Here, you will specify the dependent variable (by moving the variable Days_One_to_Seven_Number_of_Intrusions from the list of variables on the left to the field to the right labeled “Dependent Variables”) and the factor, which is the same thing as the independent variable or grouping variable as you may remember from your experience with the t-tests (by moving the variable Condition from the variable list into the field labeled “Grouping Variable” on the right). Your window should look like this: Now, consider the default setting for other commands and whether we might need more information. Under Additional Statistics, we could click the Descriptives table and Descriptives plots. In the Results panel, JAMOVI will produce some output depicting the descriptive statistics and an associated graph. Although the titles of the conditions on the x-axis are not easy to read, the graph can be helpful. Remember that we looked at the four conditions (1 = No-Task Control, 2 = Reactivation+Tetris, 3 = Tetris Only, and 4 = Reactivation Only). Then, under Variances, we could click Assume equal (Fisher’s) just in case we believe the assumption of homogeneity of variance is upheld. With that assumption in mind, under Assumption Checks, we should also select Homogeneity test. You might also request Normality test (Fisher’s); however, you might not make this selection if you already checked the data set to see if it met this assumption. In the Results panel, JAMOVI will produce some output depicting the results of the ANOVA (an ANOVA table) and the results of the assumption checking tests. The Assumption Checks will appear after the Descriptives Table, but before the Plots. That output should look something like this: Levene’s test is significant (p &lt;.05) suggesting that there is a violation of the assumption of homogeneity of variance. In other words, we cannot assume equal variances. Remember that this interpretation of Levene’s test only tells us how to proceed when interpreting the results of the ANOVA. It tells us if we should report the ANOVA using Welch’s adjustment (unequal variances among groups; heterogeneity of variance) or if we could report Fisher’s statistic (equal variances among groups; homogeneity of variance). Above the the Assumption Checks and the Group Descriptives table are the results of the One-Way ANOVA. Let’s look at this table. Because Levene’s test is significant, we should report the ANOVA with Welch’s adjustment. We see our F-statistic listed is 6.0824, with a p-value of .0019. This tests the null hypothesis that there is no difference among the groups. Since p is less than our likely alpha level (.05), we can reject the null hypothesis and conclude that there IS a difference somewhere among these groups. We may write this result in APA format as follows: An ANOVA with Welch’s adjustment demonstrated that the effect of condition on mean intrusive memories over days 1-7 was significant, F(3, 35.75) = 6.08, p &lt; .05. Had Levene’s test been non-significant, we might have reported Fisher’s statistic. In that row of the One-Way ANOVA results table, we see our F-statistic listed is 3.7948, with a p-value of .014. Since p is less than our likely alpha level (.05), we would have rejected the null hypothesis and concluded that there IS a difference somewhere among these groups. We may write this result in APA format as follows: An ANOVA demonstrated that the effect of condition on mean intrusive memories over days 1-7 was significant, F(3, 68) = 3.79, p &lt; .05. To examine the data further, let’s refer to the graph created by JAMOVI: Remember 1 = No-Task Control, 2 = Reactivation+Tetris, 3 = Tetris Only, and 4 = Reactivation Only. Alternatively, you could request an appropriate graph for these means in JAMOVI. Recall that a line graph would be useful if the variable represented on the x-axis (the independent variable) was measured using a quasi-interval, an interval or a ratio scale; a bar graph would be appropriate if that variable was measured using a nominal or ordinal scale. Also, recall that when you looked at descriptive statistics for your data set, you can easily add options to view Plots. Plots can be considered synonymous with graphs. To get these plots, click Analyses, Exploration, and Descriptives. Move the dependent variable to the “Variables” field and the independent variable to the “Split by” field. Under the Plots ribbon, select the appropriate graph. For the current example, select Bar plot. The resulting graph is much easier to read. We can see that the Reactivation + Tetris condition appears to have the smallest mean. As for the others, they are all greater than Reactivation + Tetris, but differ somewhat from each other as well. It is important to know that at this point, we do not know where the significant differences could be. For example, it could be that Reactivation + Tetris is different from only No-Task Control, or it could be that it is different from other groups as well. In order to locate where the differences are, we must conduct additional analyses called either planned or unplanned comparisons (in the next lab). 1.3.2.1 Some APA formatting reminders for writing results sections Always note the name of the test you performed (in this case, one-way analysis of variance, or ANOVA) and whether the result is significant or non-significant (Note: We do not use the word insignificant.). We usually round to two decimal places, except for p-values. If your p-value was .0001, it would be okay to write p = .0001 or p &lt; .001. Do not include a leading 0 before the decimal for the p-value (p = .001 not p = 0.001, or p &lt; .05 not p &lt; 0.05). Yes, I’m serious. No, I don’t know why. Yes, it does seem a bit silly. Yes, you lose points if you don’t adhere to APA format when requested to do so. Pay attention to spaces, parentheses, etc. APA is very picky about that. For example, it’s F(3, 35.75) = 6.08 not F(3,35.75)=6.08. There are spaces on either side of =, &gt;, or &lt; symbols. Italicize symbols such as M, SD, p, t, d, and F. 1.3.2.2 Other Commands Used to Conduct the One-Way ANOVA in JAMOVI: ANOVA Oftentimes, there is more than one way to accomplish a similar task using JAMOVI. We have examined how to conduct an ANOVA using the Analyses → ANOVA → One-Way ANOVA commands. Using the same example, let’s look at another set of commands to request an ANOVA. Click on Analyses, ANOVA, and then ANOVA. Place the dependent variable (Days_One_to_Seven_Number_of_Intrusions) in its appropriate field – in the “Dependent List” field. Then, place Condition into the “Fixed Factor(s)” field. Under the “Assumption Checks” ribbon, you could request Homogeneity test. You could also request Normality test; however, if you have previously checked the data to see if it met the assumption of normality, you would not need to do so here again. JAMOVI should generate three output tables in the output file. Let’s focus on the homogeneity test first. As we noticed when using the other set of commands, you should see that Levene’s test is significant. Based on that significant result, we would prefer to use an ANOVA with Welch’s adjustment (robust ANOVA). Recall that adjustment can be requested using the other set of commands (Analyses → ANOVA → One-Way ANOVA), and by default, the adjustment we might use was selected (Welch’s). The selection reads as Don’t assume equal (Welch’s). This robust ANOVA is not available to using the current menu options (Analyses → ANOVA → ANOVA). That is a drawback to this set of commands. This is to say that this set of commands is only useful when homogeneity of variances can be assumed. Although we did not get to request the test both with and without the adjustment using this second set of commands (Analyses → ANOVA → ANOVA), we can compare and contrast the regular overall ANOVA tests. While the table generated using these commands is slightly different from the ANOVA table generated using the other commands, you should notice the degrees of freedom, the F-statistic, and the p-value are the same in this table as they were for the row reporting Fisher’s statistic in the table generated with the other set of commands. In the Results pane, you should see this ANOVA table: Let’s compare the values found in it to the values found in the table we generated with the other set of commands. Both tables report the same statistics. 1.3.3 Homework See Moodle. "],["followup-tests.html", "Lab 2 Followup Tests 2.1 But which pairs of conditions were different?!?! 2.2 Rationale of Follow-Up Tests 2.3 JAMOVI", " Lab 2 Followup Tests This lab is modified and extended from Open Stats Labs. Thanks to Open Stats Labs (Dr. Kevin P. McIntyre) for their fantastic work. 2.1 But which pairs of conditions were different?!?! In this lab, we will continue our analysis of the James et al. (2015) dataset described in Lab #1. 2.2 Rationale of Follow-Up Tests In practice, you know before conducting your experiment and analyses whether you have reason to look for specific differences (based on what the literature says, theories that exist, etc.) or you will explore the differences without reason to look at something specific (if you have a significant result in the omnibus ANOVA). This differentiation will determine whether you will conduct orthogonal linear contrasts / planned comparisons (you had reasons to look for specific differences / a priori comparisons) or you will run a post-hoc test to explore the differences (you had no reason to look for any specific differences). In lab, we are going to take both approaches with the same example just to discuss how to do each type of follow-up. You will NOT run conduct both planned comparisons and post-hoc tests in practice – EVER. We are doing this for demonstration purposes only. 2.3 JAMOVI 2.3.1 Unplanned Comparisons: Method 1 One way to find the differences between groups in a one-way, or one-factor, ANOVA is to conduct something called a post-hoc test. This test is also referred to as “unplanned” because you don’t have to plan it before you run your ANOVA. However, you can only conduct unplanned tests when you have a significant overall ANOVA. The post-hoc test is neat because it is conveniently summoned during the process of conducting an ANOVA, and its results are presented in a compact table. Let’s use a post-hoc test to look at this data. Although there are many types of post-hoc tests, a commonly used one is Tukey post-hoc test when the assumption of homogeneity of variance is met. When that assumption is violated, Games-Howell is commonly used. Let’s begin. We are going to go through similar steps as discussed in order to conduct our ANOVA: Go to Analyses, then ANOVA, then One-Way ANOVA… Place the dependent variable (Days_One_to_Seven_Number_of_Intrusions) in its appropriate field – in the “Dependent Variables” field. Then, place Condition into the “Grouping Variable” field. Next, click the ribbon labeled Post-Hoc Tests. Below the ribbon, options for various post-hoc tests are available. We are going to choose Games-Howell (Question: Why are we selecting Games-Howell?): In the Results pane, JAMOVI will produce the ANOVA table, and tables for descriptive statistics and assumption checks if you requested them, followed by a table that refers to the post-hoc test. Let’s look at the table: Notice that the table avoids redundancy; it considers the comparison between No-task Control and Reactivation + Tetris to be same as that between Reactivation + Tetris and No-task Control. In essence, we only need to look at half of the table. To simplify what we need to read, the JAMOVI output shows only the top right triangle (and excludes the bottom left triangle). If you start reading along row 1, we see this row compares No-task Control with Reactivation + Tetris. We see the corresponding p-value for this row is .031. Because this is less than our likely alpha level (.05), this means that these two conditions ARE significantly different from one another. Look through the table: Are there other p-values that are less than alpha (.05)? Reactivation + Tetris compared with Reactivation Only has a p-value of .013. This is also a significant difference. These are the only significant differences we see here. This means that, among the 4 groups, only two differences were found: Reactivation + Tetris is different from No-task Control, and Reactivation + Tetris is different from Reactivation Only. Notice that those p-values in yellow boxes are significant while those in black boxes are not significant. (Note: We could have asked JAMOVI to flag the significant p-values.) There is no option to request the effect sizes of these differences here; however, you could calculate them. 2.3.1.1 Writing the Results An ANOVA using the Welch adjustment revealed a significant effect of condition on number of image-based intrusive memories recorded in the diary after intervention, F(3, 35.75) = 6.08, p = .002. A post-hoc Games-Howell test indicated that the mean number of memories for the Reactivation + Tetris group was significantly different from the mean of two other groups: No-Task Control, p = .031, and Reactivation Only, p = .013. The mean number of memories for the Reactivation + Tetris group was not significantly different from the mean of the Tetris Only group, p &gt; .05. Specifically, the Reactivation + Tetris group reported fewer memories (M = 1.89, SD = 1.75) than the No-Task Control group (M = 5.11, SD = 4.23) and the Reactivation Only group (M = 4.83, SD = 3.33), but not significantly fewer memories than the Tetris Only group (M = 3.89, SD = 2.89). No significant differences were found between any other groups, p &gt; .05. 2.3.2 Unplanned Comparisons: Method 2 Within JAMOVI, there are different ways to run post-hoc tests, with different options depending on which you choose. To access the other method, you click Analyses, then ANOVA, and then ANOVA commands. Place the dependent variable (Days_One_to_Seven_Number_of_Intrusions) in its appropriate field – in the “Dependent Variables” field. Then, place Condition into the “Fixed Factor(s)” field. Alternatively, highlight the results generated in the Results pane. This time, click the Post Hoc ribbon. Move the Condition variable from the left field to the right field by highlighting the variable and clicking the right-facing arrow. You should notice that by default, Tukey’s correction is selected. You might also notice that there is no option to request Games-Howell. Since we noticed a violation to the assumption of homogeneity of variance and have seen the results of Games-Howell in a previous section, we would have liked to have had that option. You do not need to rerun the commands; you can just look at the results shown for this hypothetical situation: While we cannot view request Games-Howell with this set of commands (Analyses → ANOVA → ANOVA), you can see that had we been looking for Tukey’s correction with the other set of commands (Analyses → ANOVA → One-Way ANOVA and requesting Tukey’s), we would have generated the same results in that case as we did using this set of commands. Although the lack of the Games-Howell adjustment is a drawback to this set of commands, an advantage to this set of commands is that you could request the effect sizes here. To request that JAMOVI generate them, click on Effect size. Remember: It is a good idea to check whether the data set meets the assumption of homogeneity of variance before deciding which menu provides the best options for you. 2.3.3 Planned Comparisons For the sake of our demonstration, let’s follow the planned comparisons that the researchers reported. It is very likely their planned comparisons were based on the literature about visual images and memory. They report three planned comparisons: No-Task Control vs. Reactivation + Tetris Reactivation + Tetris vs. Tetris Only Reactivation + Tetris vs. Reactivation Only We did not discuss how to access planned comparisons in the first set of menu options in JAMOVI (Analyses → ANOVA → One-Way ANOVA) because it would require us to transform the grouping variable or independent variable for each and every comparison and then to use a different type of analysis. This is tedious work. You can more easily request a priori follow-up tests using the Analyses → ANOVA → ANOVA commands. After having selected the previously noted commands, click on the “Contrasts” ribbon and click the black arrow next to the word “none” in the field to the right. You should see a menu appear giving you options for programmed contrasts. Please visit Learning Statistics with Jamovi for more information on the types of contrasts that are programmed into JAMOVI. For a quick reference, let’s refer to Table 14.15 from Navarro and Foxcroft (2019). This following table is copied from Learning statistics with jamovi: A tutorial for psychology students and other beginners, Version 0.70, according to its CC license. Thank you to Navarro &amp; Foxcroft (2019). The best contrast option for our example is Simple; however, our groups are not in the order that allows this comparison. We want to compare Group 1 (No-Task Control) to Group 2 (Reactivation + Tetris), Group 2 (Reactivation + Tetris) to Group 3 (Tetris Only), and Group 2 (Reactivation + Tetris) to Group 4 (Reactivation Only). One way to accomplish a change in order so that we could use Simple is to move the Reactivation + Tetris group to first position in the order. Just in case you have not yet encountered recoding or need a refresher, let’s discuss one way it is accomplished in JAMOVI. First, click Data, and then, while the variable to be change is highlighted (which can be accomplished by clicking on the top of that column) click Transform. When the variable-attributes pane appears, rename the “new variable” to something that makes sense. We will use Condition_Recoded for our purposes. Also, under “using transform,” select Create New Transform…. When the pane regarding the transformation appears, indicate what should be changed. In our current example, we want to switch the first and second groups in terms of their position (We want Reactivation + Tetris to be in the first place and No-Task Control to be in the second place when the comparisons are made). Click Add recode condition to begin recoding. You may notice the term $source in this window. That term represents that this transformation you are creating could be used with other variables to be recoded later (so long as your intention in those subsequent transformations is to switch groups 1 and 2 and to keep all other groups in the original order). In the transformation we will create, our $source is Condition. Click Add recode condition to add other conditions. We do not want any changes to Groups 3 (Tetris Only) or 4 (Reactivation Only). We can close out the transformation by clicking the downward-facing arrow and then the upward-facing arrow. In the data, you will see the newly created variable for recoding condition, Condition_Recoded. Now, we can return to the planned contrasts, and move the new variable over. Click Analyses, then ANOVA, and then ANOVA commands. Place the dependent variable (Days_One_to_Seven_Number_of_Intrusions) in its appropriate field – in the “Dependent Variable” field. Then, place Condition_Recoded (or whatever you named your new variable) into the “Fixed Factor(s)” field. Click on the “Contrasts” ribbon. Use the drop-down menu by the word “none” to select Simple. In the Results pane, JAMOVI will generate an ANOVA table similar to what we discussed previously plus a novel table called “Contrasts”. It would be nice to see the names of those groups, rather than the numbers. If you like, try to add notes to your table to demonstrate what the numbers represent: While the convenience of a programmed contrast may be appealing, you should also notice a drawback of accessing the contrasts via the Analyses → ANOVA → ANOVA commands: not only are we unable to request both the regular and the robust ANOVA, but also we are unable to look at contrasts with corrections for the violation to the assumption of homogeneity of variance. As you may recall from class, it would be better to look at these follow-up tests with Hedge’s correction. Remember: It is a good idea to check your data set before deciding whether a menu and set of commands is helpful in a given case. 2.3.4 Homework See Moodle.

A. Fisher 3.1 Betcha can’t type JHDBZKCO very fast on your first try This lab activity uses the data from Behmer &amp; Crump (2017) to teach one-factor repeated measures ANOVA with-up follow comparisons 3.1.1 Study description Behmer &amp; Crump (2017) used the everyday task of typing on a computer keyboard to ask questions about how people learn to put sequences of actions together. Whenever you type a series of letters on the keyboard, you are putting a sequence of actions together, so typing is task that could be used to measure skilled sequencing. Typing also happens to be a convenient task for measuring sequencing. For example, every time a person types a letter, the timing of the button press and the letter pressed can be measured and stored for later analysis. Behmer &amp; Crump were interested in asking a few different questions, however, we will simplify everything and talk about replication. First we describe an interesting finding from previous research. Behmer &amp; Crump repeated an experiment that should also produce this same finding. If they succeed in doing this, it means the finding can be replicated, and that it happens in more than one lab. Finding from previous research: Prior research showed that typists do something funny. Skilled typists can type normal words very fast. This suggests they know how to locate all of the letters on the keyboard, and can press each letter very quickly to type words. That part isn’t particularly funny. However, if you take really skilled typists and make them type random letters like this: kwitb dhhgjtryq xkldpt mazhyffdt, guess what happens? They slow down a lot. It’s kind of weird that a typist would slow down, after all they can type letters really fast when they appear in words, but not when they appear in random orders…what gives? Last, it turns out that typists are kind of in the middle in terms of speed, if you ask them to type non-words that have similar properties to words, such as: quenp hamlke phwempy. To summarize, prior research showed that typing speed changes as a function of the structure of the text, roughly in this order from fastest to slowest. (FASTEST) Normal Words &lt; Word-like Non-words &lt; Random strings (SLOWEST) Replication question: Behmer &amp; Crump also measured typists while they typed words, non-words that were English-like, and random strings. They had some additional things they were interested in, but for us, we are interested in whether they would show the same effect. Would they replicate the pattern: Normal words (Fastest) &lt; Word-like Non-words (medium) &lt; Random strings (Slowest)? 3.1.2 Study Methods The authors conducted a repeated measures experiment. A total of 38 subjects were used for the analysis. Independent Variable: The IV Stimulus or typing material had three levels: Normal, Bigrams, and Random. Normal refers to normal 5 letter English words (like truck, or plant). Bigrams refers to non-words that have properties similar to words (e.g., phemt quilp). Random refers to 5 letter strings whose letters were totally random (qmklt gdrzn lprni). Dependent Variables: There were three dependent variables, that all measured different aspects of typing performance. Reaction times (RTs) were defined as the temporal interval between seeing a stimulus (to type), and then starting to type it (first key press). Inter-keystroke intervals (IKSIs) are the times between each key-press. Last, accuracy was also measured (correct or incorrect key-presses) The task: Participants (who happened to also be students from Brooklyn College) sat in front a computer. They were presented with one stimulus (word, bigrams, or random) at a time. As soon as they saw the string of letters, they typed it as quickly and accurately as they could, then they moved on to the next trial. Reminder, this is a repeated measures design because each participant typed letter strings from the word, bigrams, and random conditions. 3.2 Lab Skills Learned Conducting a one-factor repeated measures ANOVA Conducting follow-up comparisons 3.3 Important Stuff citation: Behmer, Lawrence P., Crump, M.

Thank you to Crump, Krishnan, Volz, &amp; Chavarga (2018). In this lab, we will use JAMOVI to: Conduct and graph One-Factor Repeated Measures ANOVA Conduct follow-up tests 3.4.1 Experiment Background As described in more detail at the beginning of this lab manual section, Behmer and Crump (2017) recruited 38 subjects to type words presented on a screen as quickly as they could. The independent variable was typing material and it had 3 levels: Normal (5 letter English words), Bigrams (5 letter non-words that have properties like real words), and Random (random 5 letter strings). The authors wanted to know whether reaction time (RT) was different according to the type of word being typed. Dependent Variables: There were three dependent variables, that all measured different aspects of typing performance. Reaction times (RTs) were defined as the temporal interval between seeing a stimulus (to type), and then starting to type it (first key press). Inter-keystroke intervals (IKSIs) are the times between each key-press. Last, accuracy was also measured (correct or incorrect key-presses). For this analysis we will use Mean RTs as our one DV. Nota bene: This is a repeated measures design because each participant typed letter strings from the Normal, Bigrams, and Random conditions. 3.4.2 Checking Assumptions Recall that the Repeated Measures ANOVA assumes: The sampling distributions are normally distributed. Consider the central limit theorem. The data are measured using an interval or a ratio scale. Consider what you know about how the data were collected and/or look at the variable attributes in the JAMOVI data spreadsheet. The data are spherical. (No two conditions are any more dependent than any other two. OR There is equal correlation among pairs of conditions. OR There is equal variance among differences between pairs of conditions.) To test this, we use Mauchly’s test. This test can be requested when you run the Repeated Measures ANOVA in JAMOVI. Challenge: On your own and using the data set to be used in our lab demonstration, check the first two assumptions. Were these assumptions met or violated? How do you know? (Be prepared to answer these questions at the beginning of lab.) 3.4.3 Conduct and graph One-Factor Repeated Measures ANOVA Here is the link to the data set we will use; it’s called BehmerCrumpMeanRTs.omv. When you open the file, it should look like this: Notice that this file contains means. Each person’s data is contained within a row: there are 3 measurements corresponding to all stimulus conditions. To calculate a One-Factor Repeated Measures ANOVA, go to Analyses, ANOVA, and then Repeated Measures ANOVA. In the pane where you enter the commands, you can label your within-subjects variable. In the window called “Repeated Measures Factors,” type the name after highlighting or clicking in the area where you read “RM Factor 1”. Remember, we are looking at a One-Factor Repeated Measures ANOVA, so we only need to concern ourselves with this section. In other words, we do not have other “factors” to consider (We can ignore “RM Factor 2”.). At this point, we need to define the levels of this factor. Notice that only two levels are being displayed in JAMOVI under the “Repeated Measures Factors” window. In its font colour, “Level 3” is light grey, rather than black. (Even if we move the names of the levels into the “Repeated Measures Cells,” JAMOVI does not rename the levels above.) If you want the names of the levels to show in your output, type the names of the levels in where you see Level 1, Level 2, and so on in the “Repeated Measures Factors” window. Then, you should highlight and drag each and every level of the factor (aka variable) from the window on the left to the corresponding area in the “Repeated Measures Cells” window on the right. Before we can look at the results JAMOVI has been generating in the Results pane, we should request Mauchly’s test. To do this, move down in commands pane (on the left), and under the “Assumption Checks” ribbon, select Sphericity tests. Just in case the assumption of sphericity is violated, you could request corrections at this time; click Greenhouse-Geisser. JAMOVI will produce a few tables in the Results pane. Much like you checked the results of Levene’s test before moving ahead to read the One-Way ANOVA table (when you performed a One-Factor or One-Way ANOVA), you should check the results of Mauchly’s test before moving ahead to read the Repeated Measures ANOVA table. Let’s do that; let’s check the results of Mauchly’s test. Mauchly’s test indicates a significant result, p &lt; .0001. The assumption of sphericity is violated. We should read the results of the Repeated Measures ANOVA table with the sphericity correction, the Greenhouse-Geisser correction, applied. To make it easier for you to read, let’s cover any information that we will not use in our interpretation of the results. From this table, we see that there is a significant effect of stimulus (or typing material) on reaction time because p &lt; .0001. We might say it more formally as follows: A one-way repeated measures ANOVA was conducted, and Greenhouse-Geisser estimates of sphericity were used to correct the degrees of freedom (ε = .59) because Mauchly’s test indicated a violation to the assumption, p &lt; .05. The mean reaction times were significantly different among the types of stimulus, F(1.17, 43.46) = 420.33, p &lt; .0001. Have a look at the two tables from which these results were taken. Can you see where these statistics were taken from? Remember this is an omnibus ANOVA result. We do not know how many differences among means exist or between which means they would be found. In order to graph this data and look at the means, go to back into the analysis commands. Remember, you can do this by clicking on the results generated in the Results pane. The commands will appear on the left of your JAMOVI file. Now, scroll down to the “Estimated Marginal Means” ribbon. Move the factor (in our example, Typing_Material_Condition) to the Marginal Means window under “Term 1”. Then, under “Output”, select Marginal means plot and Marginal means tables. In the Results pane, you should now see a graph and a table. Think about an answer to this question: Looking at the graph and considering the mean of each level, where would you guess at least one significant difference in mean reaction times between stimulus levels might be found? To the best of our knowledge, there is currently no way to request a bar graph depicting all three means using JAMOVI. 3.4.4 Conduct follow-up tests 3.4.4.1 Planned comparisons If you had a priori hypotheses about where the difference(s) may be, you would conduct planned comparisons. In JAMOVI, there is no easy way for us to request these planned comparisons because there are no built-in or programmed contrasts, and there is no way to chunk variance. As such, you would do conduct planned comparisons in JAMOVI by conducting paired-samples t-tests because, in each comparison, the reactions times are being measured from the same people. 3.4.4.2 Post-hoc tests If you had no a priori hypotheses about where the difference(s) may be, you would conduct unplanned comparisons, or post-hoc tests. To find out where the difference among these 3 conditions exists, we will use post-hoc tests. We could go through the menus again to request the post-hoc tests, or we could simplify the output in the Results pane by clicking on the Results to have the commands pop up to the left. Let’s do the latter. Next, scroll down to the “Post Hoc Tests” ribbon, move the factor (Typing_Material_Condition) to the window on the right, and then select the correction you want applied. Let’s select Bonferroni. JAMOVI will produce a new table in the Results pane. It will appear before the graph JAMOVI created based on commands entered previously. Before reading ahead, think about this: We had already written information about the results of the omnibus ANOVA. What would we now add to this write-up to help readers understand the significant result in more detail? If we wish to view and report the descriptive statistics, we could find the mean reaction times for each level (typing material condition), as well as the 95% confidence interval, in the “Estimated Marginal Means” table in the Results pane. This table does not give us the standard deviation, though. To get the standard deviations, use the commands with which you are familiar: Analyses, Exploration, and Descriptives. To get the effect sizes, you will need to calculate Cohen’s d. An appropriate formula to use follows: \\(\\hat{d} = \\displaystyle \\frac{\\overline{X}_{2} - \\overline{X}_{1}}{S_1}\\) We will need to calculate the effect size for each comparison we will report. Remember, there were three unique comparisons. We can take the mean difference from the “Post Hoc Comparisons” table or fill in each pair of means and take the difference. The calculation of effect size for the comparison between the Bigram and Normal conditions follows: \\(\\hat{d} = \\displaystyle \\frac{431.99 - 365.76}{85.69}\\) \\(\\hat{d} = 0.77\\) The calculation of effect size for the comparison between the Bigram and Random conditions follows: \\(\\hat{d} = \\displaystyle \\frac{431.99 - 596.23}{139.77}\\) \\(\\hat{d} = -1.18\\) The calculation of effect size for the comparison between the Normal and Random conditions follows: \\(\\hat{d} = \\displaystyle \\frac{365.76 - 596.23}{139.77}\\) \\(\\hat{d} = -1.65\\) Based on the statistics presented in tables presented in this section, we would add to what we had already formally written about the omnibus ANOVA and construct a Results section something like this: A one-way repeated measures ANOVA was conducted, and Greenhouse-Geisser estimates of sphericity were used to correct the degrees of freedom (ε = .59) because Mauchly’s test indicated a violation to the assumption, p &lt; .05. The mean reaction times were significantly different among the types of stimulus, F(1.17, 43.46) = 420.33, p &lt; .0001. Post-hoc pairwise comparisons with Bonferroni corrections were performed. It was found that mean reaction time in the Bigram condition (M = 431.99, SD = 103.63, 95% CI [397.93, 466.05]) was significantly different from that in the Normal condition (M = 365.76, SD = 85.69, 95% CI [337.60, 393.93]), p &lt; .0001, d = 0.64, and the mean reaction time in the Bigram condition was also significantly different from that in the Random condition (M = 596.23, SD = 139.77, 95% CI [550.29, 642.29]), p &lt; .0001, d = -1.58. Furthermore, the mean reaction time in the Normal condition was significantly different from that in the Random condition, p &lt; .0001, d = -2.69. 3.4.5 Some APA formatting reminders for writing results sections Always note the name of the test you performed (in this case, one-way analysis of variance, or ANOVA) and whether the result is significant or non-significant (Note: We do not use the word insignificant.). We usually round to two decimal places, except for p-values. If your p-value was .0001, it would be okay to write p = .0001 or p &lt; .001. Do not include a leading 0 before the decimal for the p-value (p = .001 not p = 0.001, or p &lt; .05 not p &lt; 0.05) or before ε (ex. ε = .59 not ε = 0.59). Yes, I’m serious. No, I don’t know why. Yes, it does seem a bit silly. Yes, you lose points if you don’t adhere to APA format when requested to do so. Pay attention to spaces, parentheses, etc. APA is very picky about that. For example, it’s F(3, 35.75) = 6.08 not F(3,35.75)=6.08. There are spaces on either side of =, &gt;, or &lt; symbols. Italicize symbols such as M, SD, p, t, d, and F. 3.4.6 Homework See Moodle. 3.4.7 Practice Problems In the lab demonstration, we saw that the assumption of sphericity was violated. Try changing data points until the assumption is upheld. In the lab demonstration, we saw that the assumption of sphericity was violated. Try changing data points until the assumption is upheld while aiming to minimize the changes you make overall. Use the Mean Accuracy Scores 2 data set to practice checking assumptions and running a repeated measures ANOVA with follow-up testing. When we discussed t-tests, we talked about the Mehr, Song, and Spelke (2016) study. Have a look at that data set, and try to develop a research question that might be answered with a repeated measures ANOVA. (Hint: It is okay to use only the variable name, rather than the phrase for what was measured, in your research question.)
